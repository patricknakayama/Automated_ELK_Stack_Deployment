### Description of Project

The main purpose of this project is to simulate a SOC environment and demonstrate concepts in Defensive Security, Offensive Security, and Network Forensics.

  - Scenario
    - SOC Analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system
    - Monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system.
    - Report back your findings to the manager with appropriate analysis.

  - Tasks
    - Defensive Security: Implement the alerts and thresholds
    - Offensive Security: Assess a vulnerable VM and verify that the kibana rules work as expected
    - Network Forensics: Use Wireshark to analyze live malicious traffic on the wire

  - Summary of Engagement
    - Configured Kibana alerts in Elasticsearch Watcher to monitor WordPress installation
    - Identified exposed ports and services with Nmap
    - Enumerated site with WPScan
    - Exploited vulnerable web server to obtain credentials from MySQL database and gain user shell via SSH
    - Performed network forensic analysis on live malicious traffic using Wireshark and VirusTotal
    - Identified compromised machines and provided security recommendations
